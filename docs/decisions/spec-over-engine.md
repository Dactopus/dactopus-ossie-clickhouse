# Spec over engine where they disagree

DuckDB supplies expected values in tests as a second opinion close to the
spec's Postgres-like semantics, not as ground truth. Where DuckDB and the
spec differ, the test pins the spec's value with a section reference:
`REGEXP_REPLACE` replaces every match, `DAYOFWEEK` is ISO (Monday is 1),
`MILLISECOND` is the component, `PERCENTILE_DISC` is the first value whose
cumulative share reaches `p` (ClickHouse's `quantileExact` picks one too
high whenever `p * n` is whole).
